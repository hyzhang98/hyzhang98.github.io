I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Hong Kong (working with Prof. [Ping Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aXdjxb4AAAAJ)) and a research scientist at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom. I received my Ph.D. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2024 under the supervision of Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ). My research interests include graph representation learning, noise learning, multimodal learning, generative models, and embodied AI. 

<b><font color=red>News:</font></b> We are hiring researchers / research engineers / interns. If you are interested in joining us at TeleAI, please send your CV to me (hyzhang98@gmail.com). If you are interested in our joint Ph.D. programmes (for 2026), please feel free to contact me.  

<b><font color=red>News:</font></b> We are organizing a special issue, Beneficial Noise Learning, on Pattern Recognition (Impact Factor > 7). The homepage is [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/316469/beneficial-noise-learning). Welcome to submit your manuscripts about noise (such as diffusion models, flow-based models, adversarial models, noisy labels, uncertainty, label smoothing, etc.) to our special issue. We are also organizing another special issue about vision-language models on Remote Sensing.
