I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Hong Kong (working with Prof. [Ping Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aXdjxb4AAAAJ)) and a research scientist at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom. I received my Ph.D. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University under the supervision of Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ) and B.Eng. from Xidian University. 

My research interests include graph representation learning, noise learning, multimodal learning, generative models, and embodied AI.
